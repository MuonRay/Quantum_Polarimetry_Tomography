# Quantum_Polarimetry_Tomography
a series of codes that performs polarimetry-based tomography on 810nm polarization entangled states generated from a BBO/ppKTP source in an optics setup involving x2 Thorlabs Polarimeters, polarization-maintaining fibers and x2 Thorlabs 3-paddle polarization controllers that can generate a full state tomography using 16 different measurement basis
